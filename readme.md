# Introduction

This collection covers a learning path for Basics of Programming. It covers acitivities around topics that are essential to learn basics of programming in Python.

**Note**: The content is designed based on Facilitated Learning method. Facilitated learning is an educational method where the students are encouraged to take more control of their learning process. The role of the coach (teacher) is more a learning facilitator, i.e. organising and providing resources to learners.

## Arch One:
**Programming Elements**: In **Arch One** the following programming elements are covered:

	- primitive data types: character, string, integer, float and boolean.
	- basic numerical operations: + , - , * , / , %
	- simple user inputs and print formats.
	- boolean expressions and conditional statements: if-else statements
	- loops: while and for.
	- basic string processing: length, split, join, replace, join.

As a result of participating in **BaseCamp:Arch One**, students will be able to:

1. Read, Understand and Analyze the behaviour of a Python program implementing the programming elements covered in Arch One.
2. Implement their solutions for a given problem statement using the programming elements covered in Arch One.
3. Implementing their Python programs in Python Shell and an IDE.
4. Execute Python programs using a terminal and an IDE.

This Arch is constructed in the following weeks:

- [**Week01: Linear Programs**](./week01/inf-bc-w01-python.md) 
- [**Week02: Branching Programs**](./week02/inf-bc-w02-python.md) 
- [**Week03: Iterative Programs**](./week03/inf-bc-w03-python.md) 
- **Week04: Review and Challenge**

## Arch Two:

**Programming Elements**: In **Arch Two** the following programming elements are covered:[todo: in progress]

	- functions: function definition, calling functions, return of a function, functions with arguments, positional arguments, keyword arguments, parameters default values, docstrings, anonymous functions. 
	- lists: defining, offset, slicing, adding new element, modifying an element.
	- dictionaries: creating, adding and modifying items,  extracting value(s), extracting key(s), deleting, pop and clear, iteration over dictionaries.
	- sets: creating sets, difference between sets and lists and tuples, adding and removing elelemnts, membership operator, iteration over a set, basic operations between sets, i.e. intersection, union, difference and subset.
	- namespace and scope in Python programs
	- operations of collective strctures: copy(), deepcopy(), list comprehension, dictionary comprehension, nested structures.

As a result of participating in **BaseCamp:Arch Two**, students will be able to:

1. Read, Understand and Analyze the behaviour of a Python program implementing the programming elements covered in Arch One.
2. Implement their solutions for a given problem statement using functions, list, tuple, set, and ditionaries.
3. Debug and apply basics of testing (input / output and acceptance testing) on a given Python program.


This Arch is constructed in the following weeks:
