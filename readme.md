# Introduction

This collection covers a learning path for Basics of Programming. It covers acitivities around topics that are essential to learn basics of programming in Python.

**Note**: The content is designed based on Facilitated Learning method. Facilitated learning is an educational method where the students are encouraged to take more control of their learning process. The role of the coach (teacher) is more a learning facilitator, i.e. organising and providing resources to learners.

## Arch One:
**Programming Elements**: In **Arch One** the following programming elements are covered:

	- primitive data types: characters, strings, integer, float and booleans.
	- basic numerical operations: + , - , * , / , %
	- simple user inputs and print formats.
	- conditional statements: if-else statements
	- loops: while and for.
	- basic string processing: length, split, join, replace, join.

As a result of participating in **BaseCamp:Arch One**, students will be able to:

1. Read, Understand and Analyze the behaviour of a Python program implementing the programming elements covered in Arch One.
2. Implement their solutions for a given problem statement using the programming elements covered in Arch One.
3. Organise working environment using command lines for making folders, changing paths, listing contents of a folder, managing (copy, delete, rename) files.
4. Implementing their Python programs in Python Shell and an IDE.
5. Execute Python programs using a terminal and an IDE.
