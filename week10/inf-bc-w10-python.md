# Python 10: (Plain) Data Files

**Introduction**: This document presents learning steps for Python 10. In Python 10, you will get introduced with plain data files in Python. 

**Note**: In this phase, it is expected the learner can divide the program into smaller learning steps. The goal and direction of the topics will be provided. The learning must take smaller steps towards the goals such that can implement solutions to the given problems and product(s).

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- **ORef-01**: Online Tutorial; Charles Severance; "Python for Everybody"; [Available here](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html)


## Path:

### Step: Files and Content.

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. interpret and implement Python programs using plain data files: encoding / decoding, ascii and utf-8 encodings, binary vs text files, reading / modifying / wrting binary / text data files, searching content using regular expressions.
```

#### What to Learn?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 12**, **BRef-01: Chapter 14**, **ORef-01: Chapter 7** and **ORef-01: Chapter 11** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is encoding and decoding?
   2. How can we encode a string to bytes in Python? How can we decode some bytes to a string?
   3. What are text data and binary data? Experiment with some examples.
   4. Given an existing text file, how can we open and read the content in Python? What about a binary file?
   5. Given an existing text file, how can we open and add some new content? What about a binary file?
   6. Given an existing text file, how can we open and add search for an exact value? What about a binary file?
   7. Given an existing text file, how can we open and add search for a pattern using regular expression? 

#### Exercises:

1. Design at least ten different exercises of your own. They should improve understanding topics of this step. Share your exercises with your learning community and practice.
